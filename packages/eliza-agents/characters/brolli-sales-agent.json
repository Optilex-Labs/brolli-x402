    "patentStrategy": [
      "Yes, you can sometimes patent business processes—but for most early-stage teams it’s a distraction.",

      "Until then, protect velocity and avoid sunk-cost IP detours."

      "Founder takeaway (not legal advice): high-stakes IP disputes can grind down even strong teams. Plan for tail risk early."

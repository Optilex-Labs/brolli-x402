      "answer": "Brolli is a 1-year renewable patent license delivered as a soulbound NFT.\n\nIt's meant to be a simple, checkable proof that a specific wallet address holds the license.\n\nConstraints:\n- One per wallet\n- Team purchases require one wallet per seat\n- Total supply capped at 50\n- Price is $99 during the promotion"

      "answer": "A BUIDLer is someone who actively builds real products and infrastructure in the blockchain ecosystem (not just speculation).\n\nIt's a play on the HODL meme: \"BUIDL\" means build. In practice: devs, founders, and engineers who ship code, deploy protocols, and solve real-world problems—often in fintech, DeFi, RWA, and infrastructure.\n\nBUIDLers care about functionality, compliance, scalability, and long-term utility."

      "keywords": ["dirty ip", "patent troll", "trolls", "litigation", "lawsuit", "sued", "ip risk", "enterprise patents", "portfolio", "blocking patents"],
      "answer": "\"Dirty IP\" is the practical risk that broad patent claims and asymmetric enforcement can create for startups.\n\nThe existential problem usually isn't whether you're morally right; it's that litigation cost, uncertainty, and timing can cripple a young company right when it has traction.\n\nBrolli is positioned as umbrella protection while you build: reduce a category of tail risk cheaply so you can focus on shipping and distribution."

      "answer": "It gives you time to decide without spending a fortune on legal fees.\n\nFor most early-stage teams, filing early often competes with runway and velocity. A patent is a strategy (and sometimes an enforcement tool), not a default badge.\n\nA practical approach is:\n- Keep shipping and learning what’s truly worth protecting\n- Reduce catastrophic tail risk cheaply (umbrella coverage)\n- Revisit a deeper IP strategy once you have traction, budget, and a clear reason to enforce"

      "keywords": ["business process patent", "patent a business process", "can you patent an idea", "patent a workflow", "method patent"],
      "answer": "Sometimes, but it’s often a distraction for early-stage teams.\n\nBusiness process patents can be expensive, slow, and hard to enforce. Many startups end up spending time and money on IP work before they’ve proven distribution or product-market fit.\n\nIf you’re early-stage, optimize for shipping and derisking. Decide on a deeper IP strategy later when the business can support it."

      "answer": "One real-world example people cite is Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence. Without taking a position on who was \"right,\" it illustrates a founder reality: IP disputes with giants will put you out of business.\n\nThat's the point of planning for tail risk early: you don't want a legal fight to become the thing that decides whether your product survives."

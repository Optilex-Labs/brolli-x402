### Tweet 2: Coinbase x402

How Brolli uses @coinbase x402:

AI agents call our payment-gated API. x402 verifies USDC payment automatically. Backend issues an EIP-712 voucher. Agent mints the license NFT to their beneficiary wallet.

No human intervention required. This is agentic commerce.

### Tweet 5: Pinata

Legal provenance matters.

Brolli stores notarized patent affidavits on IPFS via @pinatacloud. Every license NFT points to permanent, tamper-proof documentation.

Decentralized storage for decentralized law.
